/*
 * FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) Scheduling Algorithm Implementation in Rust
 *
 * FCFS is a non-preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm
 * where the process that arrives first in the ready queue
 * is executed first by the CPU.
 *
 * Characteristics:
 * Non-preemptive: Once a process starts, it runs to completion.
 * Based on arrival time: The process with the earliest arrival time gets the CPU first.
 * Simple and fair, but can lead to long waiiting times for shorter processes.
 *
 * This is the first activity during my OS course.
 * * The goal for this project is to convert Java implementation to Rust
 * * Learn more and dig deeper to Rust
